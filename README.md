## 📌 Project Overview
**Kudzu** is a next-generation EdTech platform developed as my **Bachelor's Graduation Project** at the Faculty of Engineering, Tanta University.

The platform addresses the challenge of personalized learning by combining a robust **Course Community** with advanced **Artificial Intelligence**. Unlike traditional e-learning sites, Kudzu features an integrated **Recommendation System** to tailor content to users and embeds **LLaMA 3 (Large Language Model)** to act as an automated, intelligent teaching assistant available 24/7.

> **Why "Kudzu"?** Just as the Kudzu plant grows rapidly and connects everything, our platform connects learners with the right knowledge and rapid growth opportunities using AI.

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Core Features

### 1. GenAI-Powered Tutor (Integrated LLaMA 3)
We integrated Meta's **LLaMA 3** model directly into the platform to revolutionize student support.
* **Automated Q&A:** Students can ask complex questions related to course material and receive instant, context-aware explanations.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The model is tuned to understand technical queries and provide code snippets or detailed theoretical answers.
* **24/7 Availability:** Eliminates the bottleneck of waiting for instructor replies.

### 2. Smart Recommendation Engine
To solve the "choice overload" problem for students, we built a custom Recommendation System.
* **Personalized Feeds:** Suggests courses based on the user's past interactions, enrolled tracks, and learning history.
* **Hybrid Approach:** Utilizes both *Content-Based Filtering* (matching course tags) and *Collaborative Filtering* (similar user patterns) to maximize relevance.

### 3. Interactive Course Community
* **Discussion Forums:** Dedicated spaces for peer-to-peer learning.
* **Instructor Dashboard:** Tools for creating courses, managing content, and tracking student engagement.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system was built with a modular architecture to handle heavy AI processing alongside web traffic.

* **Backend:** Developed using **Python** (Django/Flask) to ensure seamless integration with AI libraries.
* **AI Service Layer:** A dedicated service to host the **LLaMA 3** inference engine, optimizing response latency.
* **Database:** Structured Relational Database to manage user profiles, course metadata, and interaction logs for the recommendation engine.
* **Frontend:** Responsive and modern UI to ensure accessibility across devices.
